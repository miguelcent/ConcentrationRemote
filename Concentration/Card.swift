 Differences structs and classes:
 1)
 No inheritance. You should forget what am I "in inheritance" or not
 
 2)
 structs are "value types" classes are "reference type"
 structs assigned to a variable are COPIES of this object (IMPORTANT: in iOS, arrays are structs, dictionaries are structs, Strings are structs...)
